# BigDataProject-2024
A Distributed DSMS for data generated by [UXsim](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim) on a custom made crossing. It uses kafka, apache spark and mongodb to manage and store data.\ 
Here is a set of instructions for successful installation of the tools, including notes on what went smoothly for me. 

------------- NECESSARY TOOLS -------------\
INSTALL JAVA 8+                         OK
INSTALL PYTHON 3.8+                     OK
INSTALL MONGODB                         OK
INSTALL KAFKA                           OK
INSTALL UXSIM (python simulator)        OK
INSTALL JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS               OK*
INSTALL SPARK                           --


pip install uxsim, pymongo, pyspark, kafka-python  (OK)\
pip install pyspark-mongodb (not working)\

-------------------------------------------- INSTALL MONGODB ----------------------------------------------\
Download installer from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community.\
Simply run the installer.\

CONNECTION WITH PYTHON\
pip install pymongo             (OK)\

-------------------------------------------- INSTALL KAFKA ------------------------------------------------\
Download KAFKA from https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/kafka/3.7.0/kafka_2.13-3.7.0.tgz (first link)\
Follow the instructions provided by https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart\

*STEP 1*: extract manually through Windows GUI\

*STEP 2*: Make sure you have WSL (I have some Ubuntu distribution). \
        Go to the folder you want (here ProjectFolder/tools/kafka) and hit "bash".\
        This should get you into the WSL command center.\

*STEP 3*: START THE KAFKA ENVIRONMENT \
        zookeeper-server: To start the zookeeper-server, I encountered a problem \
        where WSL couldn't find my java distribution. I simply installed JAVA 8 \
        through WSL and things started working (hoping for the best about its \
        interaction with the tools in Windows). Zookeeper server is activated in \
        Terminal 1 - once activated, let it be.\
        kafka-server (Terminal 2 - once activated, you let it be)\
        
The next steps refer to creating topics, writinh/reading events into/from them and \
impoting/exporting data from KAFKA, all of which  are being executed in a new terminal.\
To terminate the KAFKA environment, press Ctrl+C on all terminals, by reverse order \
(first, the working terminals, then the server and lastly the zookeeper)\

CONNECT WITH PYTHON \
pip install kafka-python  \      
https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/

WARNING! Zookeeper data are storedunder the tools/kafka folder, but the Server's logs \
are stored in Linux/tmp/kafka-logs folder (check config/server.properties file)\

---------------------------------- INSTALL SPARK ----------------------------------------\
Instructions given by the exercise: https://sandeepkattepogu.medium.com/python-spark-transformations-on-kafka-data-8a19b498b32c\
*STEP 1*: Download Spark with Hadooop from https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html\

*STEP 2*: Extract manualy in the desired folder (here ProjectFolder/tools/spark)\

*STEP 3*: Follow the instructions (first link) to start Spark (loops through seeking-resetting offest)\

CONNECT WITH PYTHON             (OK)\
pip install pyspark \

CONNECT WITH MONGODB            (NOT WORKING)\
pip install pyspark-mongodb\


---------------------------------------- INSTALL UXSIM ------------------------------------\
It's a python simulator. Simply install the python package:
CONNECTION WITH PYTHON
pip install uxsim


--------------------------------- INSTALL JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS --------------------------------\
Works in VScode, not from the python terminal.
